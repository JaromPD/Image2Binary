# Image2Binary
A simple program to translate a jpg image to binary text.

THIS IS A VERY EARLY VERSION
essentially just a proof of concept for the time being.

# To Do List
- Add sizing options. ie How wide should the image be?
- Add compression. If there is a huge image every pixel shouldn't correspond to a character.
    + Possibly combine RGB values and analyze the avg RGB OR only take the RGB values of every (x amount) of pixels.
